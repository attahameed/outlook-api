Integrate Microsoft Outlook:
- Give user permissions to the API to access the Outlook calendar
- Create events
- Edit events
- List events
- Delete events

Events have to be synchronized with Outlook.

The database engine to use is optional.

The API should be online in the way you prefer, being publicly accessible

Integrate Swagger or create a Postman collection to perform the necessary queries.
